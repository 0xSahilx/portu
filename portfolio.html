    <h1>PERFECT STAY!</h1>
    <p>In this fast-paced life, being a student is a very challenging part.
        It is not easy to study away from the hometown, leaving behind your family, friends,
        and the memorable moments that you enjoyed in your childhood.<br/>
        So when it comes to choosing a hostel for students, it becomes 
        an important decision to go for a clean and favorable environment, where students can 
        create a healthy atmosphere for their studies.
